\section{PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS}

In this section we want to provide a number of performance benchmarks. The tests are running on an Intel i9-9980HK with a base clock of 2.4GHz and a burst clock of 5GHz. The CPU supports AVX, AVX2, and AVX-512.
The tests are running on a Dell Precision 7740 Workstation Laptop, meaning the burst clock can not be maintained due to cooling. As GPU we use an Nvidia RTX 3000 GPU. All benchmarks are running within Linux. For OpenCL on the GPU we use the Nvidia GPU drivers and as CPU runtime we compare the open-source POCL driver against the Intel CPU OpenCL runtime environment.
